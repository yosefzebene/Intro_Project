<h1>About the dataset</h1>
<p>This dataset is all the service request received by 311. The data returned includes information about the date and time, service and service category, neighbourhood, ward, and a location that is randomized in the area the request was made. I chose to structure the data in 5 tables. The Service Category table stores the names from the “Service Area” column of the datasets and has a one-to-many relationship with the Services table which stores the “Service Request” column of the dataset. I also did the same with the Ward and Neighbourhood columns by creating a Ward table which as a one-to-many relationship with the neighborhood table. Then lastly, I have the Request table which stores all the requests returned from the dataset and is a child of both the Services and Neighbourhood tables.</p>
